# Airpy
## Micro:bit drone with Python kode
This is a Python library for controlling a drone with micro:bit and Python code. If you open this repository in PyCharm, you will get tools that allow you to "flash" the program directly to Micro:bit. You can also save files on micro:bit and retrieve files from micro:bit. You can find these tools under Tools and External tools after the installation:

If you use an editor other than PyCharm, you only need the files airpy.py, sender_kode.py and receiver_kode.py.  If you are using MakeKit's kits (Hover:bit and Air:bit) you will have to use the file sender_kode_makekit.py and mottaker_kode_makekit.py.    

## Happy flight :smiley:
