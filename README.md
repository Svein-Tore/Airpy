# Airpy
## Micro:bit drone with Python kode
This is a Python library for controlling a drone with micro.bit and Python code. If you open this repository in PyCharm, you will get tools that allow you to "flash" the program directly to Micro.bit. You can also save files on micro: bit and retrieve files from micro: bit. You can find these tools under Tools and External tools:

If you use an editor other than PyCharm, you only need the files airpy.py, sender_kode.py and receiver_kode.py.

## Happy flight :smiley:
